       <img src="https://www.thewholesomedish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Best-Lasagna-550-500x375.jpg">
       <h3>This is my favorite recipe to make when I know I won't feel like cooking everyday during the week. Is also very good reheated and topped with applesauce (don't judge me).</h3>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>1.5 pounds ground beef</li>
           <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage (I use sweet Italian sausage but you can use whatever kind you want)</li>
           <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
           <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
           <li>2 (15-ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
           <li>1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano</li>
           <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
           <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon ground basil</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1.5 cups ricotta cheese</li>
           <li>5-ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
           <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
           <li>9 oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
           <li>2 (8-ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>In a large saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, onion, and garlic. Cook over medium heat until meat is browned and crumbles; drain.</li>
           <li>Return meat to pan, and add tomato sauce, and next 6 ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes.</li>
           <li>In a small bowl, combine ricotta cheese, Parmesan, parsley, and eggs.</li>
           <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
           <li>Spoon 1/4 of the sauce into the bottom of a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Place 3 uncooked lasagna noodles on top of sauce. Do not overlap the noodles.</li>
           <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, top with 1/4 of the sauce and 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat layers, ending with sauce, reserving 1/3 of the cheese.</li>
           <li>Bake at 45 minutes. Top with remaining cheese, and baek 15 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
       </ol>
